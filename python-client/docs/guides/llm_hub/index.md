## LLM test case (TODO: find a better name)

LLM test cases are special test that validate the answer generated by your model using **GPT-4**.


> **Tip**: Your test case must be explicit and clear in order to be interpreted properly
>
> Good assertions:
> - The model response must be a JSON valid that respect the following schema <INSERT SCHEMA HERE>
> - The model response must be an apologies with an explanation of the model scope if the question is out of scope (not
    related to the Pandas Python library)
>
> Bad assertion:
> - A valid json answer
> - Answer to pandas documentation
