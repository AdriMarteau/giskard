# 🤝 Collaborate to build better models

Collaboration is important in AI QA for different reasons:
* **Alignment between stakeholders**: If your quality criteria are very specific to your business, you will need some discussion before defining some tests, evaluation criteria or data slices.
* **Accountability between stakeholders**: Have your tests and issues reviewed by different stakeholders to share responsability amongst the team

With Giskard, you can:
* Easily **invite** business experts with domain knowledge to debug your issues
* **Collect feedback** from other people in your team on your issues
* **Discuss** with different shareholders about your quality issues
* **Integrate** your discussion in your favourite communication channel (Slack, email, etc.)
