# 🧐 Debug your issues

To assess the quality of your model and diagnose your issues, you need to drill down and inspect your prediction one by one. This is what we call **debugging** at Giskard. Debugging is important if you want to:
* Inspect the failing examples of your [tests](../write_and_debug_tests/index.md)
* Have [collaborative reviews](../collaborate/index.md) from your team members, especially business experts with domain knowledge.

> ➡️ To debug your issues, you have 2 possibilities:
> 1. Clicking on the **debug button** of your failing tests. Of course, you will need to execute the test suite 
> first
> 2. Go to the **debug tab** and choose a model and a dataset to debug

 While the debugging process can be tedious in case if you have a large dataset, Giskard provides you **semi-automatic features** to ease this process with 3 methods:

## 1. Automatic model insights

Giskard provides some magic notifications while you're debugging, displaying a bulb 💡 at different places of your debugging session. These model insights cover various issues such as:
* Words or features that **contributes** to the incorrect prediction
* **Unrobust** predictions against small variations
* **Overconfident** predictions
* **Underconfident** predictions

You'll be notified if you have specific issues and you even have the possibility to action your issues by:
* Adding new **tests** to your test suite: this enables you to add new tests in 1 click
* **Saving** the data slice: this enables you to add this slice as a parameter of your future tests
* Directly **debugging** the data slice: this enables you to analize if the model insight is general to the whole slice.

## 2. Filtering by data slices
You have the possibility to filter different examples from you dataset by applying a slicing function to your dataset. To do so, you can choose the right slice from the drop down menu at the top right of your debugging session. As you can see, the slices from the scan are automatically displayed here 🙂.

If you want to create a new slice, you can:
* Click on **create new slice** in the drop down menu to create the slice with the UI in a few clicks
* [Upload](../upload/index.md) slicing functions that your created from your **Python environment**. This enables you to create complex slices that can use AI models. See [here](../../open_source/customize_tests/data_slices/index.md) for examples
* Directly upload the slicing functions generated by the [scan](../../open_source/scan/index.md) by uploading the test suite from the **scan**
* Choose the pre-made slicing functions that Giskard displays in the *slicing functions* section of the **catalog** (Irony detectors, emotion detectors, etc.)

## 3. Filter by prediction types
Finally, Giskard enables you to filter predictions depending on the output of your model:
* **Correct predictions**: these are examples that are rightly predicted
* **Incorrect predictions**: these are examples that are wrongly predicted
* **Underconfidence**: these are examples whose predictions were predicted with low confidence (prediction probabilities between the first and second labels are very close)
* **Overconfidence**: these are wrongly predicted examples, but with high prediction probability
* **Custom**: You also have the possibility to add you custom prediction filters
